Have you ever come across a great podcast with a huge back catalog and wished there was an easy way to catch up on old episodes? Most podcast listening apps let you download old episodes, but you have to manage them manually, which can be a tedious process. With Podcast ⏪ Rewind, you can "rewind" a podcast and let your podcast listening app deliver old episodes as if they were new.

Here's how it works: You pick which episode to start with (maybe you've already listened to a few) and how often you want new episodes to come out. Podcast ⏪ Rewind will provide you with a new podcast feed that you can subscribe to in your favorite app.

Here are some examples to get you started:

* Listen to a long-running fiction podcast from the beginning with a new episode each week. (I recommend Welcome to Night Vale.)
* Learn a foreign language with a daily lesson. (I like the French podcast from Coffee Break Academy.)
* Find a re-watch podcast for a favorite TV show and watch along at your own pace. (The Office Ladies or West Wing Weekly are both good.)
