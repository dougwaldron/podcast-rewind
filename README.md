Have you ever come across a great podcast with a huge back catalog and wished there was an easy way to catch up on old episodes? Most podcast listening apps let you download old episodes, but you have to manage them manually, which can be a tedious process. With Podcast ⏪ Rewind, you can "rewind" a podcast and let your podcast listening app deliver old episodes as if they were new.

Here's how it works: You pick which episode to start with (maybe you've already listened to a few) and how often you want new episodes to come out. Podcast ⏪ Rewind will provide you with a new podcast feed that you can subscribe to in your favorite app.
