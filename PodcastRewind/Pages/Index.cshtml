    Have you ever come across a great podcast with a huge back catalog and wished there was
    an easy way to catch up on old episodes? Most podcast listening apps let you download old
    episodes, but you have to manage them manually, which can be a tedious process.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    Introducing <span class="pr-logo">@Constants.Logo</span>! Now you can rewind a podcast and
    let your app deliver old episodes as if they were new.
</p>

<p>
    Here's how it works: You pick which
    episode to start with (maybe you've already listened to a few) and how often you want new
    episodes to come out. <span class="pr-logo">@Constants.Logo</span> will provide you with a
    new podcast feed that you can subscribe to in your favorite podcast listening app.
</p>

<p>Here are some examples to get you started:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Listen to
            <a asp-page="Setup" asp-route-interval="7" asp-route-feedUrl="http://feeds.nightvalepresents.com/welcometonightvalepodcast">Welcome To Night Vale from the beginning</a>
            with a new episode each week. (You'll be caught up in about four years!)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Learn with a
            <a asp-page="Setup" asp-route-interval="1" asp-route-feedUrl="https://rss.acast.com/coffeebreakfrench">daily French lesson from Coffee Break French</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Find a re-watch podcast for a favorite TV show like
            <a asp-page="Setup" asp-route-feedUrl="https://feeds.simplecast.com/PxEW_ipK">The Office Ladies
            and watch along</a> at your own pace.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If your new feed starts to get too far ahead (or fall behind) and you want to change your pace,
    simply click the link in your podcast app to edit the rewind settings.
